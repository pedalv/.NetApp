## What is [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net)?
- [.NET Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/standard/)
> .NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

> With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, gaming, and IoT.
- Languages, you can write your .NET apps in:
> [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/) and [C# Quick start](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/quick-starts/). C# is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.

> [F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/fsharp/) is a cross-platform, open-source, functional programming language for .NET. It also includes object-oriented and imperative programming.

> or [Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/visual-basic/). Visual Basic is an approachable language with a simple syntax for building type-safe, object-oriented apps.
- A developer platform for building Web | Mobile | Desktop | Gamming | Machine Learning & AI | Internet of Things apps.
- Cross-platform, whether you're working in C#, F#, or Visual Basic, your code will run natively on any compatible OS. Different .NET implementations handle the heavy lifting for you:
> .NET Core is a cross-platform .NET implementation for websites, servers, and console apps on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

> .NET Framework supports websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows.

> Xamarin/Mono is a .NET implementation for running apps on all the major mobile operating systems.
- One consistent API
> NET Standard is a base set of APIs that are common to all .NET implementations.
- Libraries
> To extend functionality, Microsoft and others maintain a healthy package ecosystem built on .NET Standard.

> [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) is a package manager built specifically for .NET that contains over 90,000 packages.
